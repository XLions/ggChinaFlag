Description:
    This package provides programmatic implementations for drawing
    Chinese national and historical flags using analytic geometry and
    ggplot2-based vector graphics. Flag designs are constructed
    entirely from geometric primitives such as polygons and rectangles,
    without relying on external image files. The package is intended
    for educational demonstration, reproducible visualization, and
    procedural graphics in R.
